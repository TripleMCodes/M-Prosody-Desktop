Steadly sketching my life and they're drawing conclusions I'm drawing line//
They ain't getting the picture I'm drawing attention by drawing their blood//
I'm out of line and ahead of my time/
like sketching a portrait I'm drawing ahead//
Not here to be drawing attention I do this to draw out my best//
I'm writing my life in invisible ink I ain't drawing a blank//
I don't gotta be biting my togue when I ain't biting my rhymes//
Not reading the room, story of my life and I'm writing it out//
I'm crossing the line like a finish line//
Don't tell me about peeves I'm here for the pivotal//
I don't bank on nobody to spend my time//
Made my pick now I head for the pinical//

With each and every step I take I know I got my back//
Need no stepping stones won't step aside I step ahead//
I don't play it safe its safe to say you save your self//
Living on the margin and I am headed for the edge//

I live through the dark to be seeing the light//
I am here to staying I won't see myself out//
