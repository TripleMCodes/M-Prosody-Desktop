This right here for the shallow//
They complained about the stilo//
Style is dense like the tango//
So I came back in this tempo//
Don't test with no memo//
Here I come with deathrow//
Yell that out to the yellow//
I am mal to the mello//
Lost my soul in limbo//
Went through hell with a halo//
You lightwork to my shadow//
You dare me you're demo//
Bet on me on a battle//
Bet on me ain't a gamble//
I'm not fair to you fellows//
I'm here to thresh withno threshhold//
This a breeze like a fresco//
Playing no games got the cheatcode//
On these jams leaving gemstones//
Cause you'll just cap withno capstone//
Got no G in your genome//
Your only g is from a g string//
Now let that buzz like a bee sting//



To be fair I ain't here to be fair I'm feral//


Keep that source like I'm nandos//
Nonchalant l'm in zen mode//
But I can snap like I'm Thanos//
Got that smoke it's tobacco//
Not lowkey this soprano// 
Make'em pay like it's venmo//
Under arms like commando//
give me that cheese I here for the lactose//
Having that drip but making no waves you'll lacking in rap flows//
Tryna make my cashflow like the airflow//
So I give no rand to a rando//
I'm locked in I'm in grind mode//
Got it on lock like a hostage for some ransom//
