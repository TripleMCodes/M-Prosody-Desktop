Steadly sketching my life and they're drawing conclusions I'm drawing line//
They ain't getting the picture I'm drawing attention by drawing their blood// 
I'm out of line and ahead of my time/
like sketching a portrait I'm drawing ahead//
Not here to be drawing attention I do this to draw out my best//
I'm writing my life in invisible ink I ain't drawing a blank//
I don't gotta be biting my togue when I ain't biting my rhymes//
Not reading the room, story of my life and I'm writing it out//

I'm crossing a line like a finish line//
Don't tell me about peeves I'm here for the pivotal//
I bank on nobody to spend my time//
Made my pick now I head for the pinical//

With every step I take I know I got my back// 
I don't need a stepping stones won't step aside I step ahead// 
don't ever play it safe it's safe to say you better save yourself//
Living on the margin and I am headed for the edge//

Live through the dark to be seeing the light//
When I'm up on the mic//
It's organ donations I'm spilling my guts and I'm giving my heart//
I'm rich in mind, so my talk ain't cause I'm speaking my minm drawing line//(16)
They ain't getting the picture I'm drawing attention by drawing their blood// (18)
I'm out of line and ahead of my time/(10)d//


I am here to staying I won't see myself out//
I do this for the love of the gameand you don't 
I am hsre and I am allkmight, and with out me all might die Haha
Don't you stop right for I am here to save the day haha
it's time to add to the current writing time if you  know  what I mean. but you know what I mean so it don't matter man

This is what we do, and this is who we are. We builders.
